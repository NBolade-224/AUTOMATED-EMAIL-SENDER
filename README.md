AUTOMATED-EMAIL-SENDER

This App automates email sending by sending a universal email (w/ or w/-out attachments) to all email address's listed in an excel file. 

HOW TO USE:

The first step is to select an excel file that contains email addresses in Column A
This will be the column that the app uses to obtain all email addresses that will need to receive the selected file (in the next step).
Only cells that contain '@' in the value, will be selected by the app to recieve an email.

The next step is to select a file that you want each email addresses to receive. 

The final step is hit send, which will send an email to each email address listed in Column A of the excel file. It will send each email seperately (no CC).
